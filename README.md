# Virtual Theremin 
This is a computer instrument which mimics the behavior of the *theremin* using the hand-tracking capabilities of the mediapipe/cvzone framework. This project also covers(or will cover) some exploration into the area of approximating functions to fit data sets, and processing data for sonification for virtual instrumentation, as well as accompanying interplay of that with scale visualization.
