# Virtual Theremin 
This is a computer instrument which mimics the behavior of the *theremin* using the hand-tracking capabilities of the mediapipe/cvzone framework. This project also covers some exploration into the space of real-time mapping of sonic data and virtual instrumentation, as well as accompanying interplay of visualization and the conceptual landscape that such things being brought together encourages.
